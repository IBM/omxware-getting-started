### Description:
This folder contains core methodology for virulence factor prediction using gene co-localization and co-occurrence. It is applied to over 200K *de novo* and assembled bacterial genomes across 1,400 genera. The analtyics are included here and large data files are linked to deposits in the PrecisionFDA site (Note: request access to their site to view or download data).

Additionally, this folder contains an application of machine learning for assessment of virulence risk in a clinical *Klebsiella* use case. 

Please see READMEs in sub-folders for additional details.
